## Tree of Savior Lua Mods - cwLibrary ##

Here you can find all the addons I've created. Feel free to use my cwAPI to create yours too! Ask me if you need help.

#### cwAPI: 
An API of core functionalities.

Type /cw for help.

#### cwFarmed [depends on cwAPI]: 
Display how much silver you have grinded from mobs in the current section.

And also display the ammount of silver each monster dropped to you.

Type /farmed for help.

#### cwShakeness [depends on cwAPI]:
A tiny addon that disables the 'shake' the games used on certain skills. I read users having headaches and nauseas because of that, so I thought it would be nice being able to disable them while ICM doesn't get us a solution.

Type /skn for help.

## Download ##

<a href='https://github.com/fiote/treeofsavior-addons/releases'>Get the latest release here</a>

## Installation ##

Extract the zip to your Tree of Savior directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TreeOfSavior for me). Say yes to overwrite any files. An addons folder should be in the root directory. Your directories should look something like this:

Start game and login to character.

Press the "Load Addons" button. It should disappear. You're done!

## Uninstall ##

Delete any folder inside the addons directory that starts with cw. Those are my addons. You can keep the addonloader.lua since that'll keep other addons you might have still working.

## Usage ##

Right now i'm not using configuration files to control the addons settings. But most of them will let you use /somecommand to configure that. Please refer to each addon on the list at the beginning of this readme.
